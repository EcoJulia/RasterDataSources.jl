# RasterDataSources.jl

This package downloads raster data sourcess for use directly or by other Julia
packages. The collection is largely focussed on datasets relevent
to ecology, but will have a lot of crossover with other sciences.

RasterDataSources was based on code from the `SimpleSDMDataSoures` 
package by Timoth√©e Poisot.
